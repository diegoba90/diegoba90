- 👋 Hi, I’m Diego Acuna. I have a passion for software development and computer science. I'm learning each and every single day and I'm always looking for new challenges. I enjoy spending time with my wife, gaming, sports, weightlifting and going to church. I am a huge New England Patriots fan. My goal is to one day be able to use my CS knowledge to continue to bring gaming to those people who aren't able to play games in the traditional way.
- 🌱 I have had 3 years of coding experience in the following languages: C++, MySQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS3, Swift. I'm currently learning how to use Python. My goal is to become self proficient in fully implementing full stack software development and Object Oriented Programing. I'm studying Computer Science at Auburn University - Montgomery with a graduation date of December 2021.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything relating to coding.
